# Open the Damn Windows

When it's nice outside, let's make it nicer inside.  Let's open the windows.

This little app monitors the temperature inside and outside, and sends an SMS if the outside temp is pleasant and might put a smile on your face to open the windows.  It might also help you save a little money on HVAC energy usage.

It also won't irritate you too much, as messages are limited to once a day, and also you can configure a whitelist window so it won't send out an SMS when you are normally away from the house.
