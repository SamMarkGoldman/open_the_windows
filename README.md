# Open the Damn Windows

When it's nice outside, let's make it nicer inside.  Let's open the windows.

This little app monitors the temperature inside and outside, and sends an SMS if the outside temp is pleasant and might put a smile on your face to open the windows.  It might also help you cut down on unnecessary HVAC energy usage.

It also won't irritate you too much, as messages are limited to once a day, and also you can configure a whitelist window so it won't send out an SMS when you are normally away from the house.

The temperature readings are handled by DS18B20 digital temperature sensors wired into my raspberry pi.  It would be easy to switch out any temperature reading mechanism for something else.
